    stats

VERSION
    VERSION 0.1

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::WhatPulse;

        my $wp = Net::WhatPulse->new;

        my $stats = $wp->get_user('hipyhop');

        while(my ($key, $value) = each %{$stats}){
            print "$key: $value\n";
        }

        if($stats{'TeamID'} != 0){
            my $team_stats = $wp->get_team($stats{'TeamID'});

            while(my ($key, $value) = each %{$team_stats}){
                print "$key: $value\n";
            }
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a perl interface to the WhatPulse APIs.

    If an XML attribute is empty, for example if the user is not part of a
    team, the attribute will be surpressed and not appear in the returned
    data structure. Therefore always check for the existence of an attribute
    before attempting to use it.
